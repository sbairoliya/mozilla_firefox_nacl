nsPNGDecoder.h
  Main header containing the API used by external users
  i.e. declaration of the nsPNGDecoder class
  The nsPNGDecoder class has a private constructor only called by
    friend class DecoderFactory

nsPNGDecoder.cpp
  Original implementation of nsPNGDecoder class, untouched
  This file is not compiled in, and only kept for reference

nsPNGDecoder_sandboxed.cpp
  Alternate implementation of nsPNGDecoder class, where the implementation
    relies on a (sandboxed or unsandboxed) (static or dynamic) library,
    namely our "nsPNGDecoder_clib" library

nsPNGDecoder_clib.h
  Header file for our (static or dynamic) C-interface library.  This interface
    is really only used by nsPNGDecoder_sandboxed.cpp.

nsPNGDecoder_clib.cpp
  Implementation file for our (static or dynamic) C-interface library.
  Internally, contains declaration and implementation of the
    "nsPNGDecoder_clib" class, which is basically the original nsPNGDecoder
    class.  However, it only exposes its functionality via the C-binding
    functions declared in nsPNGDecoder_clib.h, so as far as anyone external is
    concerned, it's just a C library.
  It also calls out to libpng as part of its operations, and is capable of
    using static/dynamic/sandboxed libpng (I think) regardless of whether
    nsPNGDecoder_clib is being used statically, dynamically, or sandboxed.
